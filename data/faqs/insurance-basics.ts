    answer:
      "Insurance is a financial contract where you pay regular premiums to an insurance company, and in return, they provide financial protection against specified risks like illness, accidents, death, or property damage.

    question: "Why do I need insurance?",
    answer:
      "Insurance protects you from financial losses due to unexpected events. Without insurance, you'd pay full costs out-of-pocket for medical emergencies, accidents, or property damage - which could be financially devastating. Insurance provides peace of mind, financial security for your family, compliance with legal requirements (like auto insurance), and helps you plan for the future.",

When someone faces a covered loss, the insurance company pays their claim from this pool. The insurer calculates premiums based on probability of claims, ensuring the pool remains sustainable while providing financial protection to all policyholders.",

    question: "What is reinsurance?",
